DEVOPS:(Development and Operations in combination)[DEvelopmetn tools +Management(OPerational)tools]

--------------
GIT:is one of the Devops tool.
=>it is a SCM(source code Management)tool.
=>it is also a VCS(Version control System).
--------------------------------------------------
1)with the help of Git , we can have backup of our code to some Git repository. 
Advantage:
1)Remote working
2)If system crashes (then we have backup)
3)If multiple developers areworking on a same project,then they can pusht the source code to the 
common repository and everyone can have access to that repository.
-------------------------------------------------
Git: it is a command line tool installed at client side.[other tools similar to Git eg perforce,svn,clearcase]
Client side we have a [local repository].

Github:It is a Remote server central repository ,where anyone can push the data.[other eg.bitbucket]
It will be available on cloud as a [remote repository].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In client side[local Rrepository]:
when you create a git project by [git init]:
[.git]folder is created which will contain all the information about the channges made to the code by whom ,when and all.

as soon as you create git project by[ git init]:it will internally divide you folder into 3 parts:
1)working direcctory
2)staging area
3)local repository

YOur all work will be done in working area [git init]..
from there you will passs work to staging area by command[git add .] then to local repository by command[git command -m "First commit"] 
..and then psuh it [git push origin master] to your remote repository in server side[Github]

-----------------------------------------------------
[git add] comamnd:
[git add abc.java ] to add single file to the repo..
[git add .]to add all the files in the folder to the repo..
