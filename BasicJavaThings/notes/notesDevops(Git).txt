DEVOPS:(Development and Operations in combination)[DEvelopmetn tools +Management(OPerational)tools]
------------
Commands in sequence to follow:
git init
git add file-name
git status //optional
git commit -m ""
git log //optional
git remote add origin //https:
git push -u origin master

--------------
GIT:is one of the Devops tool.
=>it is a SCM(source code Management)tool.
=>it is also a VCS(Version control System).
--------------------------------------------------
1)with the help of Git , we can have backup of our code to some Git repository. 
Advantage:
1)Remote working
2)If system crashes (then we have backup)
3)If multiple developers areworking on a same project,then they can pusht the source code to the 
common repository and everyone can have access to that repository.
-------------------------------------------------
Git: it is a command line tool installed at client side.[other tools similar to Git eg perforce,svn,clearcase]
Client side we have a [local repository].

Github:It is a Remote server central repository ,where anyone can push the data.[other eg.bitbucket]
It will be available on cloud as a [remote repository].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In client side[local Rrepository]:
when you create a git project by [git init]:
[.git]folder is created which will contain all the information about the channges made to the code by whom ,when and all.

as soon as you create git project by[ git init]:it will internally divide you folder into 3 parts:
1)working direcctory
2)staging area
3)local repository

YOur all work will be done in working area [git init]..
from there you will passs work to staging area by command[git add .] then to local repository by command[git command -m "First commit"] 
..and then psuh it [git push origin master] to your remote repository in server side[Github]

-----------------------------------------------------
[git add] comamnd:
[git add abc.java ] to add single file to the repo..
[git add .]to add all the files in the folder to the repo..
-----------------------------------------------------
There are various branches:
[for login you want diff branch to be created,for validation you want diff branch to be created ...so all these you dont want to modify in a master branch so]:-
if multiple developers are working on same reository,then they will be pushing to differnet branches
and all the branches will merge together to form main branch that is [master branch].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[CREATE A BRANCH]:

If you want to work on something else ,then you should create a seperate branch for that..
command: [git branch mynewBranch] ...now whatever datat was available to master branch ,it will be available to this branch also

[SWITCH BRANCH]:
command to switch branch: [git checkout branch-name]: in whichever branch you are ,
only that branch content you can see.Other branch data will be hide from it in the folder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/varshit32yadav/varshit32yadav.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
---
This error happens when you have a commit performed in your local git repository 
and also a commit performed in your remote git repository.But both commits ae unaware of eachother.
So you have to combine both of the commits together[that is called rebasing].

comand:[git pull --rebase origin master ]: 
By this command we will pull the file from remote to 
local repo.. and then we gonna place the commits one after the other in local repo.
NOw the branches have been sequenced properly and we are ready to push to our remote reository by
performing [git push -u orgin master]for pushing the data to remote repo.
